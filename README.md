I recently worked on an extensive project involving a large e-commerce database with nearly 100,000 records. The process included utilizing SQL for efficient data querying and extraction, exporting the data into a CSV file using Python (CSV file dump), and then retrieving the data from SQL for comprehensive analysis and visualization. The insights were visualized through charts to uncover key trends and patterns.
